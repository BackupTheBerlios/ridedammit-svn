INTRODUCTION

Ride Dammit! is a web-based bicycle ride log which is designed to
be simple and easy to use.  It provides basic functionality for a
small group of riders including tracking of maximum/average type
information for different terrains and locations.

Project goals are:
1) Very simple, intuitive user interface.  Easy for anyone to
   enter in data
2) Statistics for a group of casual riders.  This system is not
   inteded to be a training system such as those commercially
   available on the web, but rather a fun way for a small group of
   riders to share their riding logs.
3) Ability to track rides based on rider, location, bicycle, and
   terrain as well as collect weather information and a ride
   description, which may include photos.

Ride Dammit! uses PHP/MySQL and is delivered entirely over the web.

This project is maintained by Nathan P Sharp.  Comments, suggestions and
bugs should probably go through sourceforge at:

But may additionally be sent to nsharp@users.sourceforge.net

INSTALLATION

This project is still very new.  No installation scripts are available
and documentation is skimpy, at best.  If you want to use this project
and have troubles, drop me a line at the address above.  I'd be
happy to help you and in the process you'll probably prod me into
doing more documentation.

To run Ride Dammit!, you need to do the following:
1) Create a MySQL database and a user which has access to it.
2) Create the initial SQL tables from the .sql file.  If you
  were creating the database named "rideDB" on the local
  computer with the username "fred":

  msyql -u fred -p rideDB <RDcreateTables.sql

3) Put the files under htdoc into a published directory on your
  web server.  For added security, you can optionally move the
  RD subdirectory to a PHP include location.
4) Edit RD/RDbootstrap.php and enter in the appropriate database
  connection information and base URL for your ride log.
5) The "authorization code" to create a new rider is currently
  hardcoded into newRider.php (as is the silly hint message).
  You'll have to add users manually in the database, manually
  fix the hardcoded values, or encourage me to correct that ;-)

MISSING:
 - A way to edit a location, bike, or user
 - A way to view info about a location, bike, or user (except
   what shows up in the normal ride views).
 - Non-hardcoded "authorization codes" and hint messages.
