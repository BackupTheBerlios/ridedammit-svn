      <h2>Introduction</h2>
Ride Dammit! is a web-based bicycle ride log which is designed to be
simple and easy to use. It provides basic functionality for a small
group of riders including tracking of maximum/average type information
for different terrains and locations.<br>
      <br>
Project goals are:<br>
      <ol>
        <li>Very simple, intuitive user interface. Easy for anyone to
enter in data</li>
        <li>Statistics for a group of casual riders. This system is not
inteded to be a training system such as those commercially available on
the web, but rather a fun way for a small group of riders to share
their riding logs.</li>
        <li>Ability to track rides based on rider, location, bicycle,
and terrain as well as collect weather information and a ride
description, which may include photos.</li>
      </ol>
Ride Dammit! uses PHP/MySQL and is delivered entirely over the
web.&nbsp; Ride Dammit! uses the GNU Public License.<br>

      <h2>Installation</h2>
This project is still very new. No installation scripts are available
and documentation is skimpy, at best. If you want to use this project
and have troubles, drop me a line at the address above. I'd be happy to
help you and in the process you'll probably prod me into doing more
documentation.&nbsp; That being said, there isn't much too it.<br>
      <br>
To run Ride Dammit!, you need to do the following:<br>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a MySQL database and a user which has access to it.</li>
        <li>Create the initial SQL tables from the .sql file. If you
were creating the database named "rideDB" on the local computer with
the username "fred":<br>
          <pre>msyql -u fred -p rideDB &lt;RDcreateTables.sql</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Put the files under htdoc into a published directory on
your web server. For added security, you can optionally move the RD
subdirectory to a PHP include location.</li>
        <li>Edit RD/RDbootstrap.php and enter in the appropriate
database connection information and base URL for your ride log. </li>
        <li>The "authorization code" to create a new rider is currently
hardcoded into newRider.php (as is the silly hint message).&nbsp;
You'll have to add users manually in the database, manually fix the
hardcoded values, or encourage me to correct that ;-)</li>
      </ol>
