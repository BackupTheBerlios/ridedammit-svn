      <h2>Introduction</h2>
Ride Dammit! is a web-based bicycle ride log which is designed to be
simple and easy to use. It provides basic functionality for a small
group of riders including tracking of maximum/average type information
for different terrains and locations.  It also contains distance 
achievement measurements, everything from "Your first mile", to "You've
ridden arond the world."<br>
      <br>
Project goals are:<br>
      <ol>
        <li>Very simple, intuitive user interface. Easy for anyone to
enter in data</li>
        <li>Statistics for a group of casual riders. This system is not
inteded to be a training system such as those commercially available on
the web, but rather a fun way for a small group of riders to share
their riding logs.</li>
        <li>Ability to track rides based on rider, location, bicycle,
and terrain as well as collect weather information and a ride
description, which may include photos.</li>
        <li>Generic enough sub-system that other activities can be 
handled.  A "Swim Dammit!" version is now available and a "By Foot" 
version should be forthcoming for handling swimming, running, and
walking logs.</li>
      </ol>
Ride Dammit! uses PHP/MySQL and is delivered entirely over the
web.&nbsp; Ride Dammit! uses the GNU Public License.<br>

      <h2>News</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>3/7/04 - Much development work has gone into play recently
        to enable the system to be used generically for other activities,
        the first of which is swimming.  Also added a new feature for
        comparing your total distance to various achievements, like biking
        across the USA.</li>
        <li>12/12/03 - Oh, if I had more time, I'd come up with a groovy news item
every month for you. As it is, just download it and try it out.</li>

 <p>I am looking for other sites using the RD system which wouldn't mind
 being a sample site.  Contact me if you are willing to have a link added

      <h2>Installation</h2>
Sufficient time to make really snazzy, easy to use installation scripts
is, well, scarce, but if you have even mild familiarity with PHP
and MySQL, you should be able to get it up and running.  If you want to
use this project and have troubles, drop me a line at the address
above and I'd be happy to help you.<br>
      <br>
To run Ride Dammit! v1.0, you need to do the following:<br>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a MySQL database and a user which has access to it.</li>
        <li>Create the initial SQL tables from the .sql file. If you
were creating the database named "rideDB" on the local computer with
the username "fred":<br>
          <pre>msyql -u fred -p rideDB &lt;RDcreateTables.sql</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Put the files under htdoc into a published directory on
your web server. For added security, you can optionally move the RD
subdirectory to a PHP include location.</li>
        <li>Edit RD/config/RDbootstrap.php and enter in the appropriate
database connection information and base URL for your ride log. </li>
        <li>The "authorization code" to create a new rider is currently
hardcoded into newRider.php (as is the silly hint message).&nbsp;
You'll have to add users manually in the database, manually fix the
hardcoded values, or encourage me to correct that ;-)</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
To UPGRADE from 0.5, you need to do the following:<br>
      <ol>
       <li>Take the old site offline temporarily by simply moving
        the old files.  The new code moves things around some, so
        don't try to install over top of an existing installation.
        Don't worry, you're data will be preserved. </li>
       <li>Make a backup of your database</li>
       <li>Update your database.  I've included a script which should
        upgrade your old database to the new format.  Use the
        .sql file "RDupdate0.5to1.0.sql".</li>
        <li>Put the files under htdoc into a published directory on
your web server. For added security, you can optionally move the RD
subdirectory to a PHP include location.</li>
       <li>Edit the RD/config/RDbootstrap.php file and make the
        necessary changes.  Do not try to reuse your old one, there
        are new options in there.</li>
       <li>You should make the changes for the "authorization code"
        as mentioned above again (sorry).</li>
      </ol>
